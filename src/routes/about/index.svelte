		Cachebox is a ZK-App based on the <a class="underline" href="https://minaprotocol.com/"
			>mina blockchain</a
		>. It is an escape game where you start on the beach and are faced with classic riddles and
		puzzles, the solutions to which unlock your path. What makes this game unique is that it uses a
		smart contract to verify correct solutions, but unlike a traditional blockchain, transactions do
		not spoil the game. The way the smart contract works means that a user can prove they know the
		solution to a puzzle, without revealing the solution itself. The source code can be reviewed at

		>, and you will find a list of winners there as well.
